I'm a __Data Engineer__, Web Developer, and Tech Lead with 17+ years in tech, specializing in data strategy, __ETL__, __orchestration__, and monitoring. I use tools like __GCP__ (Functions, __BigQuery__, Storage), __SQL__ (__Postgres__, MySQL), NoSQL (__MongoDB__) and __Python__ (__PySpark__, __Pandas__) to ensure data quality, integrity and accessibility. Since moving to Hamburg, I've been looking for a new challenge where I can leverage my technical expertise, leadership skills, and international experience.
